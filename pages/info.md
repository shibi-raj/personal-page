Aside from physics and data, I have other strong interests.  Language is one of 
them.  I moved to France in 2010, and I instantly came to love
the language.  Before I got there, I did not know any French (moving to France
without knowing French is not recommended). I started picking it up by reading, 
then I slowly started conversing.  The French can be very precise with grammar,
and through that I came to take pleasure in learning grammatical structure (even 
thinking of the mathematical structure of language).
