Aside from physics and data science, I am fascinated with languages and culture.
I was in Europe for 6 years where I lived in France, Italy, and Bulgaria.  I 
knew none of the languages when I arrived in each of those countries.  I studied
each language and over time came to some understanding of each within the 
context of their individual cultures.  Naturally, I am always doing research, 
so I also became fascinated by their grammatical and historical structure.  This 
is largely how I came to be interested in natural language processing in the
first place.
