Aside from physics and data science, I am fascinated with languages and culture.
I am Indian descent, and I have lived in France, Italy, and Bulgaria.  While
living there, I learned how and how much other places have a respect for 
their language.  I knew none of the languages when I 
arrived in each of those countries and I came to appreciate the beauty in each 
of those languages.  Additionally, I am always doing research, so I also became 
fascinated by their grammatical and historical structure.  This is largely how I 
came to be interested in natural language processing.
